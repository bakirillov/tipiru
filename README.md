Data and code for my paper about Russian adaptation of TIPI questionnaire.    
The paper "Translation and adaptation of short five factor personality questionnaire (TIPI-RU): convergent validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability evaluation" by Sergeeva, Kirillov and Dzhumagulova can be found at doi:10.17759/exppsy.2016090311    
Most of the plots and tables in the paper were handcrafted from output of R code so they don't look the same in the TIPIRU.Rnw pdf output.
